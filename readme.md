"We live the most connected world mankind has ever seen; we spend our time watching funny cat videos on YouTube, catching up with the latest drama among the trendiest, so called, 'influencers' or mindlessly scrolling infinite Instagram reels.
But have you ever wondered what's behind all of that? According to the history books (and Wikipedia), developed by the DOD in the 60s, the 'ARPANET' was to be the first glimpse humans took at the Internet
as we know it today. It was developed as a response to the need to easily intercommunicate different, separate, machines. In the 90s it had already become the 'spine' of the Internet."

At least, that's what they taught me in class. But what if there were something more? A truth hidden among the bytes and wires, so deeply that no one has ever reached it before. Until i found the tip of the Iceberg. However, this 'iceberg' is
a lot more puzzling than i thought it would be. That's why I am looking for someone smart enough to help me break through this mystery... do you think you are up to the task?

Hm? Who am I? I'll tell you once you've proven yourself.
